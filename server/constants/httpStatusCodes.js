/**
 * Retrieving resources
 *
 * You can retrieve a resource representation by sending a GET.
 *
 * Responses to your GET calls will contain:
 *
 *  - An HTTP Status Code indicating success or failure (possible codes can be found below)
 *  - Any HTTP Headers
 *  - A Response Body, which will contain the requested entity resource (if the call succeeded), or a detailed error (if the call failed)
 *
 * Creating resources
 *
 * You create a resource by submitting an HTTP POST to a resource URL. Any POST body must be represented as JSON.
 * Requests that contain body content must specify the HTTP Content-Type header with a value of application/json.
 * Responses to your create POST calls will contain:
 *   - An HTTP Status Code indicating success or failure (possible codes can be found below)
 *   - Any HTTP Headers
 *   - A Response Body, which will contain the created entity resource (if the call succeeded), or a detailed error (if the call failed)
